        This is where the WindowManager is created and manage what the button do. 
        For simplicity's sake, and because 'JWM_WindowManager' needs a valid DOM 'body' to function, the script is footer-based.
        We recommend using the 'DOMContentLoaded' event to create 'JWM_WindowManager' properly.
